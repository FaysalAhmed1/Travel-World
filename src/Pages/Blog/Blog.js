                                    Montaner once likened his work to that of a conductor: he held the baton and all the artists, such as the glaziers, the sculptors, the carpenters, the manufacturers of mosaics and paving, had to come together in sweet harmony. Well appropriately enough it was he who was chosen as chief architect for the Palau de la Musica Catalana, a building that would promote Catalan song and music as an important strand in the Catalan renaissance that was taking place at the time. Built using Montaner’s trademark red bricks, the Palace serves as a prime example of Modernista magic, with plenty of rich.

                                    uring the Catalan Renaissance even the factories were constructed according to Modernista principles and when wealthy industrialist Casimir Casaramona decided to build his textile plant on Montjuïc hill, Josep Puig i Cadafalch was commissioned to design it. The result was this vast complex built in the architect’s characteristic Neo-Gothic style, with its bare brickwork topped by Catalan vaults, pinnacles and the square towers. Sadly a nice building doesn’t necessarily relate to a thriving business and the factory closed just 7 years after opening. Today La Caixa bank owns the building building.
